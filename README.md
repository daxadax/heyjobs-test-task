##Results for HeyJobs Test Task

Firstly, thanks for the opportunity, and *THANK YOU* for making this task
related to business logic - it was actually quite enjoyable to work through.

The task itself was quite straightforward and explained well, so thank you also
for that. I've left notes throughout the code in places where I thought you
might have questions or where I wanted to explain my thought process related to
a specific line/section of code.

You can run the test suite with `rake` and to run through the full stack of this
feature and see the end result on the command line, run `rake generate_campaign_diff`

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!
